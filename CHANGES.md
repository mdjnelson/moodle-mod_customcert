## [3.8.5] - 2020-11-26

### Added

- The Grade Item Name element now works with all grade items, whereas before it was just activities (#346).
- Added enrolment start and end dates to the date element (#328).
- Added username to userfield form element (#390).

### Changed

- Removed unnecessary and confusing 'exampledata' string.
- Do not email those who can manage the certificate (#376).
- Do not force the PDF to be downloaded, instead send the file inline to the browser (#153).
- Updated the 'emailstudents_help', 'emailteachers_help' and 'emailothers_help' strings to warn users about prematurely emailing the certificate (#276).
- Do not email out certificates that contain no elements (#276).

### Fixed

- Fix repositioning elements page when resizing the browser (#343).
- Prevent error when duplicate issues exist when using the code element (#363).

## [3.8.4] - 2020-03-12

### Added

- Added extra Behat steps for new elements (#309).

### Changed

- When copying a site template the site images are also copied to the course context and then those copied images are used.
  Before, the elements would simply point to the site images. However, this meant when performing a backup/restore the
  images were not stored in the backup file (#298).

### Fixed

- Fixed the displaying of names of a custom user field (#326).
- Do not allow '0' as a value for width or height in QR code (#321).

## [3.8.3] - 2020-03-09

### Fixed

- Fixed foreign key violation (#331).

## [3.8.2] - 2019-12-16

### Added

- Added subplugins.json file (#312).
- Re-added 'code' column to user report (#264).
- Add 'userfullname' variable for email subject (#316).

### Fixed

- Do not fail if multiple certificate issues (#304) and (#295).

## [3.7.1] - 2019-06-17

### Added

- Added new custom course field element (#274).
- Added ability to specify the current date for date related elements (#289).

### Changed

- String improvements for the 'Date range' element.

### Fixed

- Use negative numbers for constants in the 'Date range' element. The reason being that we may have a module
  that has an id matching one of these positive values. Sites which are using the 'Date range' element (sites
  which are **not** using this element do **not** have to do anything) will need to re-edit each element, select
  the date item again and save. An upgrade step was not created because it is impossible to tell if the site does
  actually want the constant or if they actually want the date for the module.

## [3.6.2] - 2019-05-28

### Changed

- Always send emails from the 'noreplyuser' (#165).

### Added

- Added QR code element (#146).
- Added Date range element (#185).
- Added the number of certificates issued above the report (#266).

### Fixed

- Failures when running unit tests for multiple activities (#282).
- Check that a certificate is valid before downloading on 'My certificates' page (#269).

## [3.6.1] - 2018-12-31

### Changed

- Exception being thrown when adding the 'teachername' element to site template (#261).

## [3.5.5] - 2018-12-20
### Added

- The 'Completion date' option in the 'date' element is only displayed when completion is enabled (#160).
- Instead of assuming 2 decimal points for percentages, we now make use of the decimal value setting, which the
  function `grade_format_gradevalue` does by default if no decimal value is passed.

### Fixed

- The report now respects the setting 'Show user identity' (#224).

### Changed

## [3.5.2] - 2018-06-07
### Fixed

- Hotfix to prevent misalignment of 'text' elements after last release (#196).

## [3.5.1] - 2018-06-06
### Added
- Mobile app support (#70).
```
    This allows students to view the activity and download
    their certificate. It also allows teachers to view the
    list of issued certificates, with the ability to revoke
    any.
    
    This is for the soon-to-be released Moodle Mobile v3.5.0 
    (not to be confused with your Moodle site version) and
    will not work on Mobile versions earlier than this.
    
    If you are running a Moodle site on version 3.4 or below
    you will need to install the local_mobile plugin in order
    for this to work.
    
    If you are running a Moodle site on version 3.0 or below
    then you will need to upgrade.
```
- More font sizes (#148).
- Added new download icon.
```
    This was done because the core 'import' icon was mapped
    to the Font Awesome icon 'fa-level-up' which did not look
    appropriate. So, a new icon was added and that was mapped
    to the 'fa-download' icon.
```
### Fixed
- No longer display the 'action' column and user picture URL when downloading the user report (#192).
- Elements no longer ignore filters (#170).

## [3.4.1] - 2018-05-17
### Added
- GDPR Compliance (#189).

### Fixed
- Race condition on certificate issues in scheduled task (#173).
- Ensure we backup the 'verifyany' setting (#169).
- Fixed encoding content links used by restore (#166).

## [3.3.9] - 2017-11-13
### Added
- Added capability ```mod/customcert:verifyallcertificates``` that provides a user with the ability to verify any certificate
  on the site by simply visiting the ```mod/customcert/verify_certificate.php``` page, rather than having to go to the
  verification link for each certificate.
- Added site setting ```customcert/verifyallcertificates``` which when enabled allows any person (including users not logged in)
  to be able to verify any certificate on the site, rather than having to go to the verification link for each certificate.
  However, this only applies to certificates where ```Allow anyone to verify a certificate``` has been set to ```Yes``` in the
  certificate settings.
- You can now display the grade and date of all grade items, not just the course and course activities.
- Text has been added above the ```My certificates``` list to explain that it contains certificates that have been issued to
  avoid confusion as to why certificates may not be appearing.

### Changed
- The course full name is now used in emails.

### Fixed
- Added missing string used in course reset.

## [3.3.8] - 2017-09-04
### Added
- New digital signature element (uses existing functionality in the TCPDF library).
- Ability to duplicate site templates via the manage templates page.
- Ability to delete issued certificates for individual users on the course report page.

### Changed
- Removed usage of magic getter and abuse of ```$this->element```. The variable ```$this->element``` will still be
  accessible by any third-party element plugins, though this is discouraged and the appropriate ```get_xxx()```
  method should be used instead. Using ```$this->element``` in ```definition_after_data()``` will no longer work.
  Please explicitly set the value of any custom fields you have in the form.

### Fixed
- Added missing ```confirm_sesskey()``` checks.
- Minor bug fixes.

## [3.3.7] - 2017-08-11
### Added
- Added much needed Behat test coverage.

### Changed
- Minor language string changes.
- Made changes to the UI when editing a certificate.
  - Moved the 'Add element' submit button below the list of elements.
  - Added icon next to the 'Delete page' link.
  - Changed the 'Add page' button to a link, added an icon and moved it's location to the right.
  - Do not make all submit buttons primary. MDL-59740 needs to be applied to your Moodle install in order to notice the change.

### Fixed
- Issue where the date an activity was graded was not displaying at all.

## [3.3.6] - 2017-08-05
### Changed
- Renamed the column 'size' in the table 'customcert_elements' to 'fontsize' due to 'size' being a reserved word in Oracle.
